Remember,
<%= %> - anything will be read as raw text
<%- %> - will be read as HTML
<%  %> - will be read as javascript


with ejs we can serve static files through app.use(express.static("public")); a bit of middleware that grabs the content of a folder, in this case the "public" folder. Of course in such a case only folders that should be accessible to everyone should be in there.

route parameters = "restaurants/:id" etc, completely mandatory if you want to display things, such as the restaurant page that corresponds with that id
these are used to choose which route becomes active. They are then parsed inside the route to get its value for the route parameter


Query Parameters == optional, adds extra data to url path ie "/restaurants?order=asc
again, basically used for attaching extra information to a loaded route or URL
